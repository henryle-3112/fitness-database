Drive the hips backwards, flex the knees and lower yourself until your hips are at knee level or slightly lower. Your weight should be distributed evenly across your feet; resist the temptation to let your heels leave the ground. Ensure that your knees remain in line with your toes and that they’re not turning inwards or outwards; this puts unnecessary pressure on the joints. </p> <p> You don’t need to focus on maintaining an entirely upright spine, but try to avoid bending over too much. When it comes to posture, keeping your arms out in front of you will help you to maintain a balanced position and engaging your core will prevent arching or rounding of the back. </p> <h2>What muscles are being used during Squats?</h2> <p> Squats are well known as an effective exercise to firm the gluteal muscles. And with good reason! Few exercises challenge your glutes to such an extent. This is because the main force is generated from the muscles in the glutes. Specifically, you are using the quadriceps located on the front of the thigh, the hamstrings and the associated hip muscles, all three gluteal muscles and the two calf muscles. But did you know that Squats are also beneficial to your core muscles, including both your abdominals and lower back? Extensor muscles as well as lateral and straight abdominal muscles stabilize the movement and are challenged with each Squat. This is especially important when you consider that coordination, stability and power transfer to the entire musculature from the middle of the body. </p> <h2> Squats - burning fat and building muscle </h2> <p> Many people underestimate the benefits of leg exercises because muscular development of the lower half is often not considered a performacne or aesthetic priority. But they\'re missing out. Whether you want to build muscle or burn fat, Squats are essential! Our glute and thigh muscles make up a very large part of our total volume of muscles. For the utilization of fat, this means that exercising this part of the body uses considerable energy. For muscle building, strengthening this group of muscles implies an increased secretion of growth hormones, which in turn is conducive to overall muscle building. </p> <h2> Are Squats harmful to your knees? </h2> <p> There is a widespread rumor that Squats are bad for your knee joints. The argument is often made that the knee is not suited for the typical movement of the joint. At Freeletics, we take a very clear stand on this: in our daily lives we constantly and frequently strain the knee joint, be it only lightly or tentatively, laterally offset, with straight or bent torso. Squatting without weight is part of the basic movements of human motor activity. Joints need to be exercised to become stronger and thus being protected from injury. Only in this way will they produce more joint fluid and optimize their circulation. And let’s not forget that the most important factor for the stability of a joint is the surrounding musculature. Pay attention to the amount of squatting or knee strain you apply on a daily basis just in your basic movement and resting. </p> <h2> Squats - technique is decisive! </h2> <p> As with any other exercise, the technique is crucial! Although compared to other Freeletics exercises like Climbers or Kipping Handstand Pushups, squatting exercises are less complex, hardly any other exercise is done wrong so often, and this may indeed lead to serious injury of the knee joints. Those who have knee problems – be it before, during your workout, or since you have started with Freeletics – should examine their technique and talk to a doctor. </p> <h2> Let\'s recap: </h2> <p> There\'s no denying it: Squats are a pretty badass exercise. Done correctly, they can considerably improve lower body and core strength, muscular endurance and even balance. But, as with any exercise, it\'s worth taking time to hone your technique so as to avoid injury. </p> </div> </div>','Begin upright with the knees gently flexed.

As the muscles in the forearm and hands are smaller than the larger muscles used in many Freeletics exercises (such as the triceps and back), without adequate training, they often become the first to fatigue and the reason we struggle or give up. </p> <h2>Get a grip...but which one?</h2> <p> The strength of your grip depends on which grip you use and how often you train it. The strongest grip for Hangs and Pullup variations is usually a neutral grip, where your palms are facing each other. Other grips include pronated (palms facing away) and supinated (palms facing towards you) grips. All grips should be trained, not only for grip strength, but also for shoulder health as they stretch and strengthen your shoulders in different ways. </p> <h2>Stronger grip, stronger core</h2> <p> Gripping produces something called the irradiation effect. This means that, when you grip firmly, you generate full body tension as well as harder abdominal contractions. Try to squeeze the bar during Pullups and you might be able to bang out a few more reps than usual. The same principal also works for Bench Presses. </p> <h2> So, how to train grip strength? </h2> <p> In strength and conditioning, as well as in the functional training world, the best way to improve grip strength is through including a variety of hanging exercises in your training. Pullups and passive or active Hangs are the most popular, and should be done with different types of grips so as to holistically train the muscles in the forearms and hands. Toes-to-Bar and gym exercises such as heavy Deadlifts are also effective in training grip strength, which translates to functional strength during everyday activities. </p> <p> Grip training can be done multiple times a week as it\'s on the low end of the spectrum when it comes to fatigue of the central nervous system. That means that your body (brain, motor units and muscles) recover fairly quickly (24-48h) after a hard training session of working your grip. </p> <h2> Let\'s recap </h2> <p> Adding a grip-focused session to your workout routine two or three times a week can lead to serious rep and set gains. Take on the challenge for yourself; we guarantee it’ll have you hanging on for dear life. </p> </div> </div>','From Pullups and Hanging Leg Raises to Bench Presses and Deadlifts, the amount of reps and sets you are able to complete often depends on the strength of your forearms and grip.

Often considered the king of lower body movements due to its movement complexity, Pistol Squats offer the perfect combination of strength, mobility and balance. </p> <p> Here are our top tips to find your balance and execute the perfect Pistol Squat. </p> <h2> Performing the Pistol Squat </h2> <p> A Pistol Squat begins and ends in the hips. Begin on one leg with the other outstretched at close to a 90 degree angle from your body. Try to maintain a neutral spine and an upright chest to counter the hip hinge that sends your hips backwards. Imagine that your spine is being squeezed by a corset; doing so will mean that your shoulders draw down and back, engaging your core. </p> <p> As you lower yourself to a seated position, stay active in the hips and knees and keep your arms stretched out in front of you for balance. Aim to keep the extended leg slightly to the side and rotate your upper body slightly away from your working leg, keeping your heel on the ground. At the lowest point of the movement, your hips should be below your knee. Once you’ve reached this position, put extra weight on your standing foot and imagine trying to push through the floor until you return to a standing position. </p> <h2> Key points to remember </h2> <p> Rotate your knee out towards your little toe. This external rotation creates tension around the knee and hip joint and increases stability while also allowing the hip-joint to move, reducing the risk of hip impingements. </p> <p> Keep your chest upright and spine neutral, but draw your shoulders down and back to lean forward slightly. This will stabilise your shoulder joints and spine, meaning that you’re well-balanced and maintaining good posture. </p> <p> Keep your foot flat on the ground at all times, aiming to push evenly from heel to toe. </p> <p> Aim to get your hips below your knee at the bottom of the movement. If this is beyond your reach to begin with, consider practicing the movement with Assisted Pistol Squats, using a bench, couch or resistance band for support. </p> <h2> Let’s recap: </h2> <p> Pistol Squats are a challenging lower body exercise that, over time, improve mobility and leg strength. As with all exercises, proper technique should always come before speed and quantity, so focus on perfecting the Assisted Pistol Squat before heading over to its big brother. </p> </div> </div>','The Pistol Squat is an iconic Freeletics exercise and, when done correctly, can be seriously beneficial for lower body strength and mobility.

While some like to claim that success is dependent on luck, the truth is that the best players are top athletes who follow intense and varied training programs. But training for soccer isn’t just about practicing your penalties. If the World Cup is inspiring you to get to the top of your game, you should mix up your training with cardio, strength and bodyweight training, as training expert Florian Nock explains. </p> <h2> Why should soccer players work out? </h2> <p> Soccer is an intense sport that requires a certain level of fitness and a broad skill set. Working on technical skills such as dribbling, passing, and shooting on the field will see you improve to a certain extent, but also focusing on your general strength and fitness will enhance performance even more so. Including bodyweight exercises in your training is one way to do this. </p> <p> The following full body exercises are especially useful for soccer players as they focus on the lower body without neglecting the core. Targeted at increasing strength, agility, and balance, including these in your soccer training will also help to reduce the risk of injury. </p> <h2> 1 workout, 5 bodyweight exercises </h2> <h2> Split Lunges </h2> <p> Let\'s start with plyometrics. Lunges are a compound movement that target the entire lower body, including the quads, hamstrings, glutes, and calves. Plyometrics are a highly effective way to bulletproof and sharpen your entire body, whatever your sport of choice. Working in the sagittal plane means that your stability, mobility, strength, power and dynamic balance will all be challenged. </p> <h2> Cossack Squats </h2> <p> This particular squat variation offers several benefits for soccer players looking to improve their physical skills. Unlike the split lunge, this is a transversal plane movement and so engages a totally different set of muscles. As an active exercise employing a full range of motion, it targets the mobility and flexibility of the ankles, knees, and hips, reducing the risk of injury. Alongside benefits to agility, Cossack Squats are also an excellent exercise for strengthening the adductors, quads, and glutes. </p> <h2> Side Plank Twists </h2> <p> As with any sport, core strength is a crucial component of performance success. Having trained the lower body in the sagittal and transverse plane with the exercises above, it’s now important to train the core in the frontal plane. Side Plank Twists are an excellent way to increase your core strength, providing strength and stability both in the upper and lower body, while also developing the mobility and balance of the torso. </p> <h2> Pullups </h2> <p> Now it\'s time to develop your upper body strength and to focus on the posterior chain. Pullups are a great compound exercise that target the back, deltoids and biceps. If this exercise is too difficult, the modified versions can be just as effective; think Assisted Pullups, Negative Pullups and Jumping Pullups. </p> <h2> Spiderman Pushups </h2> <p> Pushups are one of the best bodyweight exercises to train the upper body pushing kinetic chain, i.e. the chest, deltoids and triceps. Despite what you might think, a strong upper body is essential for soccer as it will give you the edge in one on one challenges. The added leg movement in this particular exercise also targets the hip flexors, increasing strength and mobility in this area too and helping to enable sudden bursts of speed. </p> <h2> Let’s recap: </h2> <p> Technique is one thing, but fitness and strength is the thing guaranteed to bring your soccer performance to the next level. Try incorporating some of these exercises into your training program and see the results for yourself. </p> <p> Get your personalized Training Journey now </p> </div> </div>','Soccer is one of the most popular competitive sports out there.

But how do you know if your workout was actually effective in keeping you on the path towards achieving your goals? In order to see the big picture, we must gauge the effectiveness of our fitness regime in the long term. </p> <p> Whether your goal is weight loss, muscle gain, or both, the same principle applies: you can’t manage what you can’t measure. Tracking your progress is a simple but effective way to get you on the way to reaching your goals, as training specialist Christian Soetebier explains. </p> <h2> What does a successful fitness regime look like? </h2> <p> Before you start tracking, make sure to align your measurements to your goal. For example, if you want to lose body fat, you should find a way to measure this precisely. The same is true if you want to gain muscle. In science, this is called “validity”, i.e. measuring what you want to track. </p> <p> The other principle to apply to your tracking is reliability. This means that your method of choice should produce similar results under consistent conditions. For instance, your weight can fluctuate by up to 2kg throughout the course of a day. You’re obviously heavier right after a generous meal, so you should make sure to weigh yourself under similar conditions each time. </p> <h2> Scale weight </h2> <p> Perhaps the easiest method of tracking changes to your body is through your weight. However, this is also the worst way to track progress as it can’t really show you how your body composition has changed. How much you weigh says little about your body composition; you may still weigh the same, but have lost fat and built muscle. Monitoring your weight alone doesn’t take body composition into account, therefore this isn’t a valid way to determine whether your fitness regime is working. </p> <h2> Body Fat Percentage </h2> <p> Measuring your body fat percentage has become increasingly simple; many body weight scales can actually measure your body composition via a weak electric current. There are also a lot of coaches proficient in taking caliper measurements to calculate your body fat. While the validity of the exact measurement you’ll obtain from these methods is questionable, they’re comparable if taken under the same conditions every time. </p> <h2> Circumferences </h2> <p> Physically measuring the circumference of a body part is a very low-tech way to track progress, but can be effective if you’re targeting the physical appearance of certain areas of the body. Simply use a measuring tape and track how the numbers change. However, make sure not to do this straight after a workout; the so-called “pump effect” that occurs immediately after training means that your muscles will be slightly bigger for a short time. </p> <h2> Progress Photos </h2> <p> This is one of the best methods if you simply want to look better. As the saying goes, “a picture speaks a thousand words”. Progress photos, when taken with the same lighting conditions and at the same time of day, can really enhance your fitness journey by showing you exactly how you have physically changed over time. Don’t get disheartened; photos taken only a week apart are unlikely to show much change, but over a longer period of time, you’ll start to see more obvious results. </p> <h2> How you feel </h2> <p> As you progress with your fitness regime, your times will likely improve and your PB’s will get faster and faster. While an improvement of a few seconds might not seem like much, it’s a surefire sign that you’re progressing. Looking back over your history of PB’s for a certain God is a good way to remind yourself how far you’ve come. </p> <p> Many of us get fixated on the numbers – more reps, more weight, less fat, more muscle. And while tracking data regularly is effective and can ensure that you’re headed in the right direction, what really matters is how you feel. If you can feel yourself becoming happier, stronger and more confident, you know you’re on the right track. Likewise, how you feel physically is important; if you find it takes you less time to recover after an intense training day, it’s a sign that your body is adapting to your fitness regime. </p> <h2> Let’s recap </h2> <p> There are multiple data-based methods by which you can track whether your fitness programme is doing its job, but the most important indicator of how close you are to your goals is how you feel and how you perceive yourself. </p> </div> </div>','There’s no better feeling than that which comes after a good, exhausting workout.

The two are inherently linked; when we are stable and mobile, we are able to call on our power from an extensive variety of angles and positions. In this article, training specialist Carlo Reumont evaluates the logic and science behind mobility and stability. </p> <h2> Mobility: what’s it all about? </h2> <p> While flexibility is the passive range of motion one can reach around a given joint, mobility refers to the amount of that range of motion you can actually “use” during any given movement. Mobility is therefore limited by flexibility. </p> <p> Mobility takes into account everything important to be able to perform movements properly: softening hardened muscles, treating joint restrictions, as well as loosening the soft tissues. Whenever it comes to movements like squats, burpees or running, it’s important to have good mobility. </p> <p> Muscle fibers know only two movements: contraction and stretching. When we work out, we strengthen the contracting abilities of our muscle fibers. However, this also tends to shorten our muscle fibers. The results: we feel stiff and immobile, which may actually have adverse effects on our fiber’s ability to produce strength. The mobility of each fiber matters, as well as the smooth operation of fiber bundles and fascicle bundles. Their collaboration contributes </p> <p> This makes stretching very important for relieving the muscle and increasing mobility. Pressure therapy through a massage or a foam roll can give short term relief, as this realigns muscle fascicles. Stretching also helps realign the muscle fibers. </p> <p> Mobility is about more than simply stretching and flexibility. It is a secret to more power – power that comes from calling on your muscles’ full capacity. </p> <h2> Stability: power is nothing without control </h2> <p> Stability is the ability to withstand dynamics and turbulence. Research in biomechanics shows that the key to stability is controlling the center of gravity during movement. </p> <p> Stability comes from the coordination of the center of gravity and the base of support (the surface on which the body is in contact with the ground); a large center of gravity alone won’t do if your base of support is small. The better they work together, the more stable your movements. </p> <h2> There are two key lessons to ensure stability: </h2> <h2> 1. Know your center of gravity. </h2> <p> This is found around the stomach and hip area. Practice feeling into this point in your body with the strongest gravitational pull. This way you’ll move with more awareness of your core and remain stable in all positions. </p> <h2> 2. Make your base as big as possible. </h2> <p> Your connection to the ground is either through your hands, your feet or both. Get a clear sense of where and how you are connected to the ground and broaden your connection if you can. </p> <p> Stability is more than simply strength. It’s the effective control of balance, the alignment of the body and, in connection to mobility, the coordinated activation of muscles. It’s logical: the firmer your foundation, the more controlled and coordinated your movements will be. The key phrase here is “quality of movement”. </p> <p> Focusing on quality of movement will initially slow down your workouts. This might seem like a step backward. In the long run, however, with increased stability and coordination you will expand your physical capabilities, as you are standing on a broader foundation. </p> <h2> Let’s recap: </h2> <p> Progression requires a two-pronged approach focusing on both mobility and stability in tandem. Neglecting these could otherwise result in a downward spiral of poor coordination and a reduced capacity to apply the body’s strength. </p> </div> </div>','Mobility and stability play crucial roles in almost any physical activity.

Because a long-term healthy lifestyle knows no finish-line. And the key to continuing to evolve? That’s you, and the choices you make. </p> <h2> 1. Live, sleep and breathe NoExcuses </h2> <p> NoExcuses is a mindset that goes beyond completing an Aphrodite. By adopting this mentality in all aspects of your life, you break free of barriers and continue to push yourself up to and beyond your limits. Changing your perspective as an athlete is a simple yet effective way to reach your goals both on and off the training ground. </p> <h2> 2. Celebrate the milestones </h2> <p> What do you do when you have finished a training journey and crushed your PB? Do you do a fist pump, a few Clap Claps and immediately start focusing on your next goal? Or do you take a moment to reflect on your achievement - where you were and where you are now? While it’s true the only way to keep growing is to keep setting new goals, it’s also super critical to applaud what you accomplished as you reach each one. Because, in the end, that is what really keeps you motivated to stay on the long road to transformation. </p> <h2> 3. Know your “Why” </h2> <p> Establishing the “why” behind your goals is the first step to reaching them. Determining what it is that motivates you will make you more likely to reach your goals as it gives you something to focus on, even when times are tough. And this shouldn’t be a merely superficial goal; so you want to lose weight for summer - why? Is this to feel more confident? Happier in yourself? More satisfied with your lifestyle? Even aesthetic goals have a deeper “why” behind them. Establishing what your “why” is will keep you on track to reach them. </p> <h2> 4. Set SMART Goals & CHARM to achieve them </h2> <p> Achievable goals are SMART and have CHARM. SMART goals encourage focus and action and are a way of bringing structure and measurability into your goals and objectives. By ensuring that your goals are specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-based, you’re more likely to reach your objectives. But it doesn’t end there. Once you’ve set your goals, you need a strategy to achieve them. Consistency, Honesty, Accountability, Re-evaluation and Motivation are the things to bear in mind once we’ve set the wheels in motion. They’re what make your goals a reality. </p> <h2> 5. Make use of your Freedom </h2> <p> Freedom is choice and with choice comes responsibility. As Free Athletes, you’re able to train wherever, whenever and however you like; you’re not restricted by boundaries, gym opening hours or ineffective workouts. Busy? Tired? Not seeing results? Free Athletes aren’t held back by these things. The clue is in the name; Free Athletes are free to train in the way that best suits them. Free Athletes have the gift of freedom, it’s up to you how you use it. </p> <h2> 6. Maximize your 24 hours </h2> <p> Everyone has the same 24 hours in a day to do as they wish. So why do some people manage to achieve more in this time than others? It all comes down to productivity. How can we use our time to do the most of what matters to us? Stop wishing you had more hours in your day and start making them. Wake up earlier, take shorter but more regular breaks and learn how to say “no”, but also when to say “yes”. All of these will help you to do more, experience more and achieve more. </p> <h2> Let’s recap: </h2> <p> We can help you on your way to becoming your greatest version, but at the end of the day, it’s down to you. This World Freeletics Day, put the excuses aside, set your goals and celebrate yourself - it’s in your hands. </p> </div> </div>','6 years and 0 excuses.

What’s the difference between salt and sodium? And why do we need salt in our diet? These are all questions which need answering and nutrition expert Leanne Edermaniger has the answers. </p> <h2> What is salt? </h2> <p> The salt we put on our food is also known as sodium chloride (NaCl) and is a mineral which is a major constituent of seawater. Although too much salt in our diet can be harmful, sodium is an absolute necessity for our body and brain. </p> <h2> What is sodium and why do we need it? </h2> <p> Around 40% of table salt is sodium. Sodium is a naturally occurring mineral and an electrolyte which is present in all our body fluids, including the blood. The nervous and cardiovascular systems in particular need sodium to function effectively. Sodium is an electrolyte found in the blood which helps to conduct electrical impulses in the body. Electrolytes such as sodium also keep the fluid balance in the body regulated as well as helping muscles to contract and relax. Changes in the tonicity (the relative concentration of dissolved solutes) of cells can cause dehydration, muscle cramps and alterations to brain cell function. </p> <h2> Why should we limit our salt intake? </h2> <p> Guidelines state that adults should eat no more than 6g of salt or 2.4g of sodium per day. A diet high in salt can lead to high blood pressure and heart problems. When too much salt is consumed, the kidneys are put under a great deal of pressure to remove the excess sodium and the body has to store extra water which increases blood pressure. </p> <p> Although sodium plays an important role in our diet, it needs to be controlled to ensure our fluid balance remains stable. Most pre-packed foods now have nutrition labels on them, many of which include the salt content. Some foods might tell you how much sodium is present rather than the level of salt itself. If this is the case, you can convert this to salt by multiplying the sodium level by 2.5. For example, 1g of sodium per 100g would be 2.5g of salt per 100g. </p> <p> Foods high in salt include processed meats, cheese, olives, anchovies, salty fish, peanuts and soy sauce. Other, perhaps less obvious salt-heavy foods include bread, pizza, soup, ready-made pasta sauces, ready meals and condiments. </p> <p> Keeping an eye on food labels is one way to cut down the amount of salt you’re eating but there are other ways too. </p> <h2> Eat clean </h2> <p> Simply reducing the number of times you eat out and the number of ready meals you eat will help to reduce your salt intake. Preparing meals from scratch using fresh ingredients is healthier and allows you to control how much salt goes into your meal. </p> <h2> Find out if hypertension runs in your family </h2> <p> Does a member of your family have high blood pressure? If so, hypertension may be a genetic trait in your family. You can be fit and healthy, but you may have high blood pressure simply because it’s in your genes. If this is the case, you should regularly have your blood pressure checked and actively reduce your salt intake. </p> <h2> Let’s recap: </h2> <p> Sodium is an important electrolyte which the body requires to keep its fluid balance regulated, but it’s important to stay aware of how much you consume </p> </div> </div>','The salt we put on our food is also known as sodium chloride (NaCl) and is a mineral which is a major constituent of seawater.

Good nutrition is therefore paramount to meet the energy demands of the body, as health expert Leanne Edermaniger explains. </p> <h2> Nutrition for HIIT </h2> <p> To meet the energy demands of a HIIT workout, it’s essential that you eat the right foods. Although you don’t necessarily need to make drastic dietary changes, it’s important to be aware of what and when you’re eating. After all, there’s no point in completing the exercise only to load up on extra carbs immediately after. </p> <h2> Pre-workout </h2> <p> The intensity of HIIT means that your body needs to have a ready supply of nutrients. A few hours before your workout, you should consume digestible carbohydrates and proteins in a ratio of 3:1. Digestible and slow-release carbs include whole grain bread, oatmeal and nuts. These can be paired with protein sources like lean chicken, fish or tofu. Foods high in fiber should be avoided pre-workout as these can cause stomach cramps. Equally, too much protein or fat is not a good idea either as these take a long time to digest and be converted into energy. </p> <h2> During the workout </h2> <p> HIIT is not a training method that lends itself to mid-workout snacks. Instead, the only thing you should be consuming during a HIIT workout is still water. You might not want to waste valuable seconds taking a drink, but getting thirsty can distract from performance. </p> <h2> Post-workout </h2> <p> Within 2 hours of your workout, try to eat carbohydrates, proteins and some sugar to replace the energy used and to repair damaged muscle, but only eat just enough to satisfy your appetite, especially if your goal is to lose weight. Effective post-workout foods include eggs, wholegrains and fish. </p> <h2> Let’s recap: </h2> <p> The benefits of HIIT are wide-ranging, but you’ll only truly see these benefits if you fuel your body correctly. Combining HIIT with the right foods and a healthy diet will not only boost energy, improve performance and optimize results, but has even been proven to positively impact motivation and your mental state. </p> </div> </div>','As the name suggests, high intensity interval training, or HIIT, is intense, physical and requires large amounts of energy.','nutrition-for-hiit','The HIIT nutrition 101','http://localhost:8080/greenwich-fitness/api/v1/resources/upload/blog/the_hiit_nutrition_101_blog_2019_07_08_08_54_11.jpg','2019-07-07 16:58:49','2019-07-07 16:58:49',1,3,'nutrition-for-hiit','As the name suggests, high intensity interval training, or HIIT, is intense, physical and requires large amounts of energy.',1,0,1,1),(11,'<div id=\"content\"> <h1 id=\"title\">Foods you didn’t know were healthy</h1> <img id=\"banner\" src=\"http://localhost:8080/greenwich-fitness/api/v1/resources/upload/blog/food_healthy_blog_2019_07_08_08_59_59.jpg\" alt=\"\"> <div id=\"main-content\"> <p> If you pay close attention to your diet and the foods you fuel your body with, you may think it’s relatively easy to tell healthy food apart from unhealthy options. But sometimes, all may not be as it seems, and foods which you assume aren’t healthy, are, and vice versa, of course! </p> <p> When it comes to determining whether a food is healthy or not, there are many things to consider, including calorie content, nutrient density and the type of fats it contains. While there are foods which are quite obviously healthy, there are some which may surprise you, as Training and Nutrition Expert David Wiener explains... </p> <h2> 1. CHEESE </h2> <p> Cheese has a bad reputation due to its high calorie and fat content, however it is a good source of calcium, protein and vitamin D. Some cheeses are healthier than others, for example, feta is at the lower end of the calorie and fat scale, and as it’s a strong-tasting cheese you don’t need to eat as much to satisfy your cheese craving. Other healthy cheese options include goats cheese, cottage cheese, ricotta and parmesan. </p> <h2> 2. POPCORN </h2> <p> Although popcorn is normally viewed as a snack food, it actually does provide some nutritional benefits. First off, it is low in fat and high in fibre, and it also contains small amounts of vitamins and minerals including zinc, magnesium and some B Vitamins. As with any food, make sure you stick to recommended portion sizes and pay close attention to any additional sugar or salt. </p> <h2> 3. BURGERS </h2> <p> Burgers that don’t contain a high amount of fat (such as lean beef, turkey or veggie burgers) can prove that eating well doesn’t have to be boring. Burgers made from lean beef contain iron, vitamin B12 and protein which all have health benefits. Don’t get too carried away though, burgers from fast food chains and lots of ‘traditional’ burger toppings, can quickly turn a burger into an unhealthy option; as always, homemade is always better. </p> <h2> 4. KETCHUP </h2> <p> Ketchup undoubtedly has a high sugar and salt content, but on the flipside, it does offer some surprising health benefits. According to one study, eating ketchup two or more times a week can reduce a man’s risk of developing prostate cancer by approximately 20 percent. Because of its tomato flavour, ketchup contains lycopene, an antioxidant which is believed to cut cholesterol and even boost sperm count. </p> <h2> 5. BUTTER </h2> <p> Years ago, butter was a total no-no with people holding it responsible for raising cholesterol levels and clogging arteries. However, in recent years butter has fallen back into favour with people instead focusing on its health benefits, especially in comparison to other heavily processed spreads. Butter is a good source of CLA, a type of fat which could reduce the growth of certain cancers and can also decrease body fat percentage. It also contains butyrate, a short chain fatty acid which can reduce inflammation and promote digestive health. It is still important to remember that butter is high in saturated fat and calories, so as with everything else, enjoy it in moderation. </p> <h2> Let’s recap: </h2> <p> The key to a healthy diet is enjoying everything in moderation, and the same goes with the foods listed above. If you’re working towards a health or fitness goal it is important to pay close attention to your nutrition, but no food should be off limits. </p> </div> </div>','If you pay close attention to your diet and the foods you fuel your body with, you may think it’s relatively easy to tell healthy food apart from unhealthy options.

Meat isn’t the only source of protein out there, and it certainly isn’t the most eco-friendly, as nutrition expert Florian Nock explains. </p> <h2> Why meat production has a significant impact on our environment </h2> <p> Everything comes at a cost. As meat is nutritious, high in proteins, B vitamins, and minerals, it also has a higher impact on the environment than plant-based food. It requires more energy to produce meat as calories are lost for feeding the animals; up to 9 calories of plant-based food are required to provide 1 calorie of beef. </p> <p> Furthermore, meat production is the single most significant contributor of methane to the atmosphere, a gas that has serious egregious effects on global warming. Different types of meat produce different levels of methane emissions; meat from cows and sheep usually necessitate more emissions than chicken, for example. </p> <p> It’s not just emissions and food; agriculture uses more freshwater than any other human activity with nearly a third of our usage used for livestock. For instance, it can take up to 16000 litres of water to produce 1 kg of beef, four times the amount required for producing the same amount of beans. </p> <h2> What you can do to reduce your plate\'s footprint </h2> <h2> Reduce your meat consumption </h2> <p> The idea that you \"need meat to be strong\" has been debunked many times. There are many plant-based foods high in protein that can help you optimize your gains. Moreover, many of these foods are also high in fibers that will support a healthy digestive system. If you\'re not intending to become vegetarian or vegan, you still can switch from meat to legumes and grains at least twice per week. </p> <h2> From red to white </h2> <p> Overconsumption of red meat is not only detrimental to our planet, but it can also have an adverse effect on our health. For the benefit of both your health and the environment, you should limit your red meat intake to one to two servings per week. White meat, eggs and dairy are excellent alternative sources of proteins, and they also have a smaller footprint. </p> <h2> Go organic </h2> <p> Whether it\'s for your health or the environment, it\'s a wise option to go organic and local as much as possible for your meat, dairy and eggs. Meat and dairy from cattle fed with grass provide healthier fats than their inorganic counterparts. Moreover, the preservation and management of grasslands can contribute to carbon storage and support local farmers. </p> <h2> Be open-minded </h2> <p> Food scientists and entrepreneurs are working to develop nutritious and tasty protein alternatives with a lower environmental impact. In the future, this could mean that we\'re eating algae, artificial meat or even insects. </p> <h2> Let’s recap: </h2> <p> Your personal food decisions have a significant impact not only on your health but also on the planet. We’re not saying that you should become vegetarian tomorrow, but taking time to consider what you eat and where it comes from is important not only for our own health, but for the planet as a whole. </p> </div> </div>','Our food choices don\'t only affect us, they also affect our planet.

Here’s why it’s a good thing</h1> <img id=\"banner\" src=\"http://localhost:8080/greenwich-fitness/api/v1/resources/upload/blog/hungry_all_the_time_blog_2019_07_08_09_25_16.jpg\" alt=\"\"> <div id=\"main-content\"> <p> Experiencing hunger is totally normal. Being an athlete comes with an appetite and the harder you train, the more you eat. But why? What happens within the body? And how can you prevent this from affecting your progress? Read more to find out. </p> <h2> Hunger is good </h2> <p> How many times have you said in an angry voice “why am I so hungry all the time”? Hunger is usually seen as the bad guy. But actually hunger is good. It’s a sign that your body is using your food as fuel. The way that it’s supposed to. And when you’re hungry, this means it needs more. So as long as you know the right things to eat and how to tell the difference between real hunger and just being bored, it’s not a bad thing. And you shouldn’t always ignore it. </p> <h2> When your muscles are hungry, you’ll know about it </h2> <p> Weight lifting and strength training is likely to leave you with the biggest appetite afterwards. As your muscle tissue repairs, it cries out for food to help it regain strength. And the more muscle you have, the more hungry you are. So keep your fridge filled with healthy protein rich foods to keep the beasts at bay. </p> <h2> Hunger or dehydration? </h2> <p> If you’re used to training in summer, you might know the feeling of starvation after a sweaty workout. Approach this hunger with care. Because sometimes, it’s dehydration in disguise. When we sweat we lose sodium and this can cause us to develop cravings for sugar or salt. Next time you come home from a summer run, take a big drink of water before making any rational eating decisions. You might just find you weren’t so hungry after all. </p> <h2> Fear of overeating? </h2> <p> Of course hunger isn’t good when every time you’re hungry you dive into a bag of something unhealthy and keep eating until there’s no space left. This is when you will overeat. With that being said, it’s also not good to grab something small and unsatisfying. This will just leave you feeling hungry again in an hour. </p> <p> It’s a mixture of quality, quantity, the right time and the right place. Choose nutritious foods, high in protein which are likely to leave you feeling fuller for longer. An example of this is baked oatmeal and dried fig. Head over to the Freeletics Nutrition App for this recipe and many more. Another tip is to workout right before a meal, like breakfast, dinner or lunch. You were going to eat anyway so this saves you from a snack you might have had otherwise. </p> <p> Don’t expect your body to perform at its best, if you don’t provide it with enough fuel. Set yourself up for success. Eat Clean. Train hard. Stay healthy. </p> </div> </div>','Hungry all the time since you started working out?

Going gluten-free has become a popular nutritional choice in recent years and gluten intolerances are on a persistent upward curve, but what does it actually mean to go gluten-free? Nutrition expert Leanne Edermaniger gives us the 101 on everybody’s favorite food component to cut. </p> <h2> What’s the deal? </h2> <p> Simply put, gluten is a complex mix of hundreds of storage proteins found in cereals such as wheat, barley and rye. Derived from the Latin word for “glue”, gluten acts as both a binding and extending agent and is often found in processed foods. </p> <h2> Which foods are gluten found in? </h2> <p> Gluten is found in many foods. The most obvious sources include bread, pasta, flour, biscuits and cereals. However, gluten can also be found in foods you might not expect including processed meats, many sauces, sweets and multiple vegetarian protein alternatives. </p> <p> In bread, gluten forms when molecules of glutenin and gliadin - major proteins found in wheat flour - form a matrix in which they become chemically linked, forming the elastic substance, gluten. </p> <h2> What does it mean to be gluten intolerant? </h2> <p> Gluten intolerance occurs when you have difficulty digesting food containing gluten, prompting an unpleasant physical reaction. For people with an intolerance to gluten, symptoms which can occur after eating foods with gluten include stomach pain, bloating, diarrhoea and skin rashes. </p> <p> An important point to note is the difference between an intolerance and an allergy. An allergy involves the immune system and can cause symptoms which are serious and may even be life-threatening. An intolerance to gluten is merely a sensitivity; the reaction is unpleasant, but it isn’t dangerous. </p> <h2> Coeliac Disease </h2> <p> Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disorder where individuals develop an immune reaction to gluten. Coeliac disease is not an allergy or an intolerance to gluten. The major organ affected by the coeliac disease is the small intestine, however, it can present itself in many ways. The classic symptoms of coeliac disease include diarrhoea, weight loss and abdominal pain. </p> <p> When someone has coeliac disease, their immune system mistakes the components of gluten as a potential threat to the body and so attacks these substances. As a result of this immune attack, the usually healthy tissue on the surface of the small intestine becomes damaged and so the body is no longer able to digest and absorb the nutrients from food effectively. </p> <h2> Are there gluten-free alternatives to common foods? </h2> <p> One way to avoid the symptoms associated with gluten intolerance, allergy or coeliac disease is to stop eating gluten. Following a gluten-free diet has been made easier because there are many common foods which now have gluten-free alternatives - think bread, pasta, rice and cakes. </p> <p> Although you can buy many gluten-free alternatives to common foods, there are also plenty of naturally gluten-free foods available too. Fruit, vegetables, nuts and seeds are all gluten-free, as are many dairy products (milk, cheese, eggs and natural yoghurt). </p> <p> But beware… </p> <p> If you know that you have an intolerance, it pays to be vigilant. Gluten can be hidden in some foods or be present in foods that have accidentally come into contact with gluten-containing products. </p> <h2> Let’s recap: </h2> <p> Going gluten-free isn’t necessarily a healthy alternative to a standard diet, but for people with even the slightest intolerance to gluten, it can make all the difference. </p> </div> </div>','Gluten is a complex topic, and not just in terms of its chemical makeup.

While it’s true that we each tend towards a particular body type, individual differences actually play a far more important role in determining our body types, as training specialist Florian Nock explains. </p> <p> In the 1940s, American psychologist William Herbert Sheldon developed a classification system for the human body, in which he claimed that all people were either ectomorphs, mesomorphs or endomorphs. </p> <p> Ectomorphs were defined as slender, lean and best suited to endurance activities. In contrast, endomorphs were seen as strong, larger and able to gain muscle quickly. Finally, mesomorphs were a combination of both; naturally athletic, high-responders and equipped to lose fat and gain muscle. </p> <p> Within just a few years, psychologists started to discredit this theory. Nevertheless, this classification system is still seen as the benchmark by many in the fitness community. </p> <h2>Ectomorph, mesomorph, endomorph: The problems of putting people in boxes</h2> <p> The first problem is that this system is an oversimplification; we can\'t classify body types into just three classes. Every one of the seven billion people on earth has a slightly different body type. </p> <p> The second issue is that this classification system isn’t fixed. We change and evolve, so many of the \"gifted\" mesomorph athletes were formerly endomorphs or ectomorphs. </p> <p> Lastly, by restricting us to fixed types, it limits our perception of what we can achieve. Someone considered an ectomorph might think that it’s impossible for them to ever gain strength, so they never even bother trying. An endomorph could believe that they can\'t lose weight, when, with a few lifestyle changes, there’s no reason why they couldn’t. </p> <h2> Where do our individual differences come from? </h2> <p> Genetics play a considerable role in determining individual differences. At a macro level, some characteristics are influenced by our DNA and ethnic heritage. We also inherit traits from our relatives and, at an individual level, we all have unique characteristics such as the proportion of muscle fiber types and the length of our limbs. These characteristics combine to form a very individual body type. </p> <p> Training can also affect individual differences. The impressively lean bodies of long-distance runners and the powerful muscles of weightlifters were not genetically determined, but forged on the training ground. Our individual differences are affected by our training method, frequency, and intensity. With endurance activities like running and HIIT, you train the slow twitch muscle fibers and can develop some “ectomorphic” traits such as low body fat and lean muscles. During strength training, you build your fast-twitch and intermediate fibers\' muscle which increases muscle size. </p> <p> Finally your lifestyle plays a considerable role. By being active and looking after your body, you improve its ability to gain muscle and lose fat. </p> <h2> Let’s recap: </h2> <p> You define your body traits. A combination of all of these factors determines our body type, not an anachronistic and limited classification system. Genetics is only one part of the equation; your current body type characteristics are an image of what you did until today; it\'s up to you to define and work on your next body. </p> </div> </div>','There’s a common belief that we fall into one of 3 body type categories; we\'re either ectomorph, mesomorph or endomorph.','the-myth-of-body-type-classification','The myth of body type classification.','http://localhost:8080/greenwich-fitness/api/v1/resources/upload/blog/the_myth_of_body_type_classification_blog_2019_07_08_09_45_08.jpg','2019-07-07 17:49:02','2019-07-07 17:49:02',1,4,'the-myth-of-body-type-classification','There’s a common belief that we fall into one of 3 body type categories; we\'re either ectomorph, mesomorph or endomorph.',1,0,1,1),(18,'<div id=\"content\"> <h1 id=\"title\">5 hacks to boost your metabolism</h1> <img id=\"banner\" src=\"http://localhost:8080/greenwich-fitness/api/v1/resources/upload/blog/5_hacks_to_boost_your_metabolism_blog_2019_07_08_09_52_17.jpg\" alt=\"\"> <div id=\"main-content\"> <p> On the most basic level, metabolism is the combined processes of your energy intake and expenditure, and your metabolic rate is the speed of your metabolism, or the number of calories you burn over a specific period of time. Generally, there’s not too much we can do to change our metabolism, but there are a few effective ways to tweak it to your advantage, especially if you want to lose weight, as training specialist Christian Soetebier explains. </p> <h2> #1: HIIT </h2> <p> A staple component of the Freeletics experience is high intensity interval training (HIIT). And for good reason! Not only does HIIT have a strong anaerobic cardiovascular training effect, but it also induces the EPOC effect. EPOC stands for “Excess post-exercise oxygen consumption” and describes the increased rate of oxygen intake following HIIT training. What does this mean? Well, the strenuous nature of HIIT forces your body to tap into a wide range of metabolic and energy processes. So while you rest, your body is still busy restoring its balance and burning off calories in the process. </p> <h2> #2: Strength Training </h2> <p> While HIIT provides you with the benefit of the EPOC effect, strength training itself can burn a lot of calories and, over time, improve body composition. Regular strength training means that the muscles being engaged burn more calories when resting, and this figure will increase the more often you train. If your goal is to lose weight and gain muscle, strength training should be part of your training regime and shouldn’t be overlooked. </p> <h2> #3: More protein </h2> <p> Surprising as it may seem, there’s actually a way to burn more calories by eating more: consuming protein! When we eat protein, our body is forced to use energy to get to all the amino acids within the protein. This is known as the “thermic effect of food”, or TEF, and makes protein weigh less in terms of caloric balance compared to other macronutrients such as carbohydrates. </p> <p> At the same time, eating more protein will help you build more muscle and to improve your body composition while also decreasing appetite. </p> <h2> #4: Drinking more water or green tea </h2> <p> Another way to boost your metabolism is to avoid liquid calories that are “empty” such as soda. Focus instead on calorie-free beverages such as water and tea! </p> <p> Stimulating drinks like green tea and coffee are also known for their metabolism-boosting effects as they decrease appetite. However, always be careful not to drink tea or coffee too late during the day or you’ll lose sleep – another factor that may be bad for your metabolism. </p> <h2> #5: NEAT </h2> <p> A less obvious (but nonetheless effective) way to get your metabolism going is to increase NEAT. This is the abbreviation for “non-exercise activity thermogenesis” and describes every way in which you burn calories by moving that isn’t actual exercise. A simple everyday example of this would be to take the stairs instead of the elevator. NEAT can be highly effective in boosting your metabolism as, unlike training, it can be done constantly throughout the day. </p> <h2> Let’s recap: </h2> <p> Metabolism is fairly set in stone, but there are a few things you can do to boost it slightly and enhance physical results. </p> </div> </div>','On the most basic level, metabolism is the combined processes of your energy intake and expenditure, and your metabolic rate is the speed of your metabolism','boost-your-metabolism','5 hacks to boost your metabolism','http://localhost:8080/greenwich-fitness/api/v1/resources/upload/blog/5_hacks_to_boost_your_metabolism_blog_2019_07_08_09_52_17.jpg','2019-07-07 17:56:40','2019-07-07 17:56:40',1,4,'boost-your-metabolism','On the most basic level, metabolism is the combined processes of your energy intake and expenditure, and your metabolic rate is the speed of your metabolism',1,0,1,1),(19,'<div id=\"content\"> <h1 id=\"title\">Circadian rhythms and the power of habit</h1> <img id=\"banner\" src=\"http://localhost:8080/greenwich-fitness/api/v1/resources/upload/blog/circadian_rhythms_and_the_power_of_habit_blog_2019_07_08_09_59_08.jpg\" alt=\"\"> <div id=\"main-content\"> <p> On a genetic level, our bodies work in cycles which repeat themselves every 24 hours. In exercise science, this is called your circadian (from the Latin \"around the day\") rhythm. It works on different levels and has a strong impact on your whole body. While the central mechanism remains stable, we can influence many important athletic attributes by how we act throughout the day. To stabilize good rhythms, consistency is key, as training specialist Christian Soetebier explains. </p> <h2> Circadian Rhythm Genes </h2> <p> The genes that drive our circadian rhythm are present in every cell of our body, but the master clock controlling them sits within the brain and is connected to our eyes. This is why daylight is the most important signal for the time of day for our body. Such a signal is also called a “zeitgeber”, German for ‘time giver’. However, light is not the only signal our body uses to adjust its rhythm... </p> <h2> Why stable habits are key </h2> <p> Our bodies are very complex intertwined systems that follow regular patterns. The more we respect those patterns and stabilize them, the better our system works. The less we follow them, the more negative effects we feel. </p> <p> It is therefore important to use the power of habit to our advantage and boost our performance and stay healthy. </p> <h2> How you start and end your day really matters </h2> <p> Our primary zeitgeber is light, which reaches our brains through our eyes. This process begins the moment we open our eyes in the morning and continues until we close them again to sleep. The amount of light we receive depends on time of day (i.e. the activity of the sun) and other artificial light sources (like your smart phone or your computer). </p> <p> Our body measures the process of moving through our circadian rhythm throughout the day according to the amount and quality of light it receives. However, it loses its orientation when exposed to different signals at times of the day when it’s not expecting them. To keep your rhythm stable, try to stay consistent in your wake-up and sleeping times. In particular, try to avoid too much exposure to artificial light during the later parts of your day. </p> <p> When you work out matters Exercise is a secondary zeitgeber and sets time for our peripheral muscle cell clocks. This means that muscle metabolism and strength also follow a circadian pattern which is easily regulated by following a regular workout schedule. </p> <p> Our muscle cells have their own internal clock and so our muscles’ strength and metabolism are also bound to our circadian rhythm. Therefore, it’s not only the type of exercise, but also the timing of your exercise that matters. Having a stable exercise habit can really enhance your performance, especially for harder workouts or competitions. </p> <p> For example, if you train in the morning every day, you’ll be stronger, faster and have more endurance at that time of day compared to in the evening. The same is true for any other time of day as long as you perform your workout at the same time consistently. </p> <h2> Let’s recap: </h2> <p> Developing regular habits regarding light exposure and exercise can help keep your body’s circadian rhythm more stable on a genetic level. By keeping light exposure and workout timing regular throughout the week you can reap the benefits of your circadian rhythm and perform at an optimum level. </p> </div> </div>','On a genetic level, our bodies work in cycles which repeat themselves every 24 hours.

This process not only increases the size of the muscle but also its strength and ability to withstand greater loads as well as protects it against soreness and damage caused by previous training. In this article, you’ll find out what happens within your muscle when it grows, which movements trigger the hypertrophy process and why it’s about way more than aesthetics. </p> <h2> The definition of hypertrophy </h2> <p> Hypertrophy is defined as a process that happens within the body as a result of resistance training which leads to the growth or enhancement of the muscle or rather the cross section of the muscle. Hypertrophy makes your muscle grow in size as well as stimulates the cell division in your muscle, a process called hyperplasia - something we’ll cover later on. </p> <h2> What happens? The process of hypertrophy and hyperplasia </h2> <p> We already told you that hypertrophy enhances the muscles cross section and increases the strength of the muscle itself, but the process also involves the body learning how to use more of its muscle fibres. Hypertrophy is therefore necessary not just for max. strength training but also to enhance performance in all kinds of sports. </p> <p> In the first 14 days to 3 weeks of hypertrophy training (we’ll come to the actual training later) the body learns to use more of the muscle fibres and to coordinate the fibres that are already there. Although no hypertrophy yet, upto 40% of progress at this stage comes down to the improved coordination that happens in the “adaptation phase” - think of it as: no growth, more fibres. Once the muscles have learned to use more fibres, they begin to grow. This growth stage is hypertrophy. </p> <p> Hyperplasia is a similar process that happens when the muscle fiber becomes too big. Here, the cells of the muscle fibre split and become smaller to provide a more energy efficient way for the body to provide the cell with the oxygen it needs. After 6 - 8 weeks, growth effects begin to stagnate unless your strength training method is changed and adapted. That’s why personalization, tailored to each individual is so important to ensure constant progress. </p> <h2> Content Hypertrophy </h2> <h2> Which training triggers hypertrophy? </h2> <p> Hypertrophy is triggered when the muscles are pushed to their limits, which can sometimes also be accompanied by muscle soreness. Training that causes hypertrophy has to involve the application of the concepts of mechanical and metabolic tension. Mechanical tension refers to resistance with weights or bodyweight training and the time your muscle is put under tension and metabolic tension describes the “burning sensation” of a muscle - so the point where your muscles start to burn when doing an exercise, for instance. The combination of these in training will result in hypertrophy (and probably some achy muscles the next day!). </p> <p> In training science, it’s stated that especially plyometric movements such as running downhill or jumping onto something is greatly related to muscle growth. Why? For plyometric exercises, your body needs to use eccentric muscle contraction in order to absorb the force your body experiences. Eccentric muscle contraction is known for creating the most severe muscle soreness, and remember: muscle soreness = hypertrophy. </p> <p> It’s also the result of max. strength training, where your body first learns how to use the muscle fibres by lifting your maximum amount of weight (under supervision of course) for 1-3 reps. Then, once these fibres have been activated, increase the number of reps to between 8-10. Why 8-10 you ask? That’s the hypertrophy trigger rule. Whether it’s bodyweight training or lifting weights, it’s known that 8 to 10 repetitions is the best amount to trigger muscle growth. You may also wonder - from a performance perspective - why your body desperately needs to grow muscle? It’s physics: a certain amount of muscle mass can only move a certain amount of weight. It’s pretty straightforward that in order to move more, you need more muscle mass. </p> <p> Big muscles deliver strength and when used properly, strength delivers daily life value - not just aesthetics. </p> </div> </div>','Hypertrophy is one part of the muscle-enhancing process that happens within the body.

Biomedical scientist Sarah Schunter has the answers. </p> <h2> Metabolism, anabolism, catabolism </h2> <p> Metabolism refers to the overall chemical processes of converting chemical substances or substrates (e.g. food and oxygen) into intermediate products (metabolites) and end products (such as water and carbon dioxide) in living beings. These processes are life-sustaining as they promote the build-up, breakdown and replacement or preservation of body mass. Furthermore, they are essential for the generation of energy in order to maintain our body’s functions. </p> <p> Depending on whether compounds are being built up or broken down, we speak of anabolism or catabolism, respectively. Simply put, anabolism usually consumes energy, while catabolism releases energy. </p> <h2> Understanding protein metabolism </h2> <p> When we apply this knowledge to protein metabolism, we learn that the breakdown of proteins into amino acids is a catabolic pathway that provides energy. As muscles are high in protein, energy can be supplied via the degradation of muscle mass. Clearly, this is something athletes want to avoid; instead they’d strive for protein anabolism in order to maintain or increase their muscle mass. </p> <p> It might not be something you want to hear, but under physiological conditions, protein anabolism and catabolism will continuously run in parallel. This means muscle mass will be more or less maintained unless you power the system towards anabolism. There are two key factors that trigger anabolism: exercise and nutrition. </p> <h2> Exercise: regular and periodized </h2> <p> When it comes to strength training, protein biosynthesis is highest around six hours after exercising and actual build up of muscle mainly occurs within the first two days after a training session. </p> <p> You don’t have to train for hypertrophy to gain muscle. The body benefits from any training method, as long as the volume and intensity are periodized regularly. This means that, ideally, you should alternate your focus between strength endurance, hypertrophy and maximum strength training several times a year. These different stimuli will have overall positive effects on muscle formation. </p> <h2> Nutrition: balanced and complete </h2> <p> A balanced diet rich in protein and carbohydrates is essential to support protein biosynthesis and muscle formation. Your daily protein intake should fall somewhere between 1.5-2 g per kilogram of body weight and should be rich in essential amino acids, especially leucine, as this is a major factor for the stimulation of protein biosynthesis. </p> <p> Carbohydrates should also not be neglected. These are a major source of energy for an effective, intense workout and intensity is crucial for optimal muscle stimulation. Contradictory as it might seem, carbs = gains! Both protein and carbohydrates should be consumed soon after finishing the workout (anything up to two hours ensures maximum uptake). Carbohydrates replenish the glycogen storage, accelerating regeneration. Protein synthesis is fueled by these carbohydrates. </p> <h2> What else? </h2> <p> Recovery is just as important a part of training as exercise and nutrition. Muscle doesn’t form during the actual workout, but rather when your body is at rest. You should therefore allow yourself days of no or very low intensity steady state training (LISS). Make sure to rest for at least 7 hours a night; most muscle gain and regeneration processes actually take place as we sleep. </p> <h2> Let’s recap </h2> <p> There are essentially two ways to stimulate muscle formation via the actions of anabolism and protein biosynthesis: training and nutrition. Both factors must be combined in order to build up muscles effectively in the long term.

Whether it’s motivation, inspiration or distraction you need, music can make all the difference to your training performance. Just what you need for your next workout? We thought so. That’s why we’ve made it as simple and straightforward as possible. The new Spotify feature in your Android and iOS Freeletics app allows you to play music directly in the Freeletics app, without having to switch. More beats, fewer excuses. </p> <p> In this article, training specialist Florian Nock gets to the heart of what it means to soundtrack your workout and what exactly science tells us about the effect of music on training. </p> <h2> Music plays a role in every stage of your training </h2> <p> When you feel tired or unmotivated, music can help you get back into the zone. Various studies conducted on professional and amateur sportspeople have shown that listening to music before working out acts as a stimulant, boosting your confidence and promoting blood flow. Research has also shown that fast tempo music played at a high volume can even increase grip strength, muscular endurance, and concentration. </p> <p> Music can also help during your warmup. Increasing the BPM of the music you’re listening to in line with your increasing heart rate has been shown to make for a more effective warmup than simply doing it in silence. To properly implement this, begin with a mid-tempo song and gradually increase the tempo to follow your heartbeat. </p> <p> Listening to music during the main body of your workout could also enhance performance. A study conducted with triathletes running on treadmills showed that music had positive effects from physiological (lactate level, VO2 consumption), psychological (RPE) and performance perspectives (delayed time until exhaustion). However, other studies have demonstrated that this is entirely dependent on the sport and that sometimes music is even counter-productive. </p> <p> Finally, after your workout, a calmer, slower song can help reduce stress hormone levels such as cortisol and decrease heart rate. Lower tempo music also encourages the breathing to slow down, allowing oxygen to more effectively reach the muscles. </p> <h2> Curate your playlist to your workout </h2> <p> For a cardio session involving repetitive running, rowing or cycling movements such as running, rowing or cycling choose music with a steady rhythm and even BPM. This will help synchronize your heart and stride rate. Studies have demonstrated that when beginners listened to music while running, they were able to run for longer than beginners who ran in silence. </p> <p> If you’re doing HIIT, music with a varying tempo is more effective as it mirrors the frequent switches between exercises typical of this type of training. The switch between slow and fast tempos has been proven to give a psychological energy burst. </p> <h2> Picking the right songs according to science </h2> <p> Researchers developed an instrument for measuring the motivational qualities of music in exercise; it is called \"The Brunel Music Rating Inventory-2 \" and helps trainers pick the right song. </p> <h2> According to this report... </h2> <p> Music with direct references to sports helps to increase motivation </p> <p> Music associated with TV shows or movies can promote the desire to engage in physical activity The music should be allied to your personal preferences. Even if a song is of the right tempo, if it isn’t a genre you personally like, it will not have the desired positive effects on your training. Music tempo should be linked to an exercise heart-rate. This is even more important when it comes to HIIT. Personal relationships with songs are important; if a song reminds you of a past victory, it could be the extra bit of motivation you need. </p> <h2> Let’s recap: </h2> <p> Playing music during your workout doesn’t just provide a fun soundtrack; research has demonstrated that listening to the right music at the right point in your workout could boost motivation and performance - but in the end it’s all about finding what works best for you. </p> </div> </div>','For the majority of people, the idea of training in silence is unimaginable.

Surprisingly, it’s not quite so clear cut. In this article, health expert Leanne Edermaniger delves into the science of appetite and exactly how we should be fueling our HIIT. </p> <p> The precise effect HIIT has on our appetite remains a topic of interest among exercise scientists. Some studies suggest that HIIT suppresses our appetite and therefore reduces our energy intake. However, there is also growing evidence to suggest that high-intensity exercise may improve the sensitivity of appetite hormones which in turn means that appetite is regulated much more effectively. </p> <p> The science of appetite Appetite is the desire to eat and can be influenced by both psychological factors and biochemicals. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a protein and signalling molecule secreted by various organs in the body and is associated with many processes within the body including appetite. IL-6 stimulates the release of hormones which are involved in the regulation of our appetite. </p> <p> Research has shown that HIIT increases the activity of IL-6 and reduces the concentration of appetite-stimulating hormones such as ghrelin. Ghrelin is sometimes referred to as the hunger hormone because it stimulates our appetite and promotes the storage of fat. It’s mainly released by the stomach but can also be released in small amounts by the brain, pancreas and small intestine. </p> <h2> The evidence </h2> <p> A study conducted by researchers at The University of Western Australia found that when a group of overweight men completed 30 minutes of HIIT, they were inclined to consume fewer calories afterwards compared to when they completed 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise. </p> <p> However, the research is conflicting, with some scientists suggesting that HIIT has no independent effect on appetite in some people, especially those who are overweight. What’s clear is that HIIT can induce similar physiological and metabolic effects as continuous moderate-intensity exercise which requires a far greater time commitment. In short, a 20 minute HIIT session could leave you just as hungry as an hour long run. </p> <h2> Let’s recap: </h2> <p> The jury’s still out on exactly what effect HIIT has on our appetite, but what we know for certain is that good nutrition is key to optimizing training performance. It goes without saying, but following a diet rich in carbohydrates, protein and healthy fats is a surefire way to set yourself on the path to HIITing your training goals. </p> </div> </div>','HIIT is intense, fast and leaves us exhausted, which must mean that it makes us hungry, right?','how-does-hiit-affect-your-appetite','How does HIIT affect your appetite?','http://localhost:8080/greenwich-fitness/api/v1/resources/upload/blog/how_does_hiit_affect_your_appetite_blog_2019_07_08_10_27_44.jpg','2019-07-07 18:29:27','2019-07-07 18:29:27',1,4,'how-does-hiit-affect-your-appetite','HIIT is intense, fast and leaves us exhausted, which must mean that it makes us hungry, right?',1,0,1,1),(24,'<div id=\"content\"> <h1 id=\"title\">Exercise and hormones</h1> <img id=\"banner\" src=\"http://localhost:8080/greenwich-fitness/api/v1/resources/upload/blog/exercise_and_hormones_blog_2019_07_08_10_30_41.jpg\" alt=\"\"> <div id=\"main-content\"> <p> The results of regular and focused training can be quite remarkable. Before long, you could be slimmer, fitter and faster. However, there are also many processes occurring inside our bodies when we exercise. Hormones and exercise have a complex but fascinating relationship and health specialist Sarah Schunter is here with the basics. </p> <h2> Training triggers hormones </h2> <p> While your muscles are being used during (and also after) exercise, a bunch of different hormones are released that affect your entire body. Hormones control distinct regulatory and metabolic pathways, necessary for energy production, muscle building and fat reduction. The major hormones involved in exercise are... </p> <h2> Adrenaline and Noradrenaline </h2> <p> These two hormones belong to a group called catecholamines and are produced in the adrenal medulla. Anyone experiencing stressful situations knows exactly how the release of adrenaline feels: once released to the bloodstream, heart rate and blood pressure increase. In their role as stress hormones (triggering “fight or flight” reactions) they provide rapid energy through fat breakdown (lipolysis) as well as the release and biosynthesis of glucose leading to elevated glucose levels in the blood. During exercise, this supplies the muscles with energy. </p> <h2> Cortisol </h2> <p> Cortisol is a major steroid hormone which acts as an activator for catabolic pathways in order to provide high energy compounds e.g. during exercise. Cortisol triggers the production of glucose, acts on fat metabolism by promoting the lipolytic effect of adrenaline as well as noradrenaline and regulates protein turnover (catabolic). Cortisol levels in our blood vary during the day. The highest value is reached in the morning as the body is deprived of energy. However, when getting up we need to be active, meaning we need energy which will be provided by glucose. </p> <h2> Hormones of Happiness </h2> <p> So-called happiness hormones are often produced during exercise: dopamine and serotonin, endorphin and enkephalin and endocannabinoids contribute to the feeling of well-being and euphoria by acting as neurotransmitters in our brain. They are released especially during endurance training; the so-called \"runner\'s high\" mainly occurs during long distance runs. </p> <h2> Testosterone </h2> <p> Alongside its function as male sex hormone, testosterone is also responsible for muscle formation, firmer bones and stronger hair. Depending on age, fitness level and workout intensity, testosterone levels increase for between 15 and 60 minutes after training. Testosterone is produced in both sexes, but significantly more so in men (which is why it’s easier for men to develop muscle). </p> <h2> Peptide YY (PYY) </h2> <p> This hormone consists of 36 amino acids and is released from endocrine cells residing in the distal small intestine. The release of PYY is mainly induced postprandial (after eating) by fats. The hormone acts on brain regions that are responsible for appetite and hunger. It means that we’re less hungry after exercise and feel full faster after a meal. Studies have shown that endurance training significantly raises PYY levels. </p> <h2> Let’s recap: </h2> <p> It’s crucial to have an understanding of which hormone balances you might be influencing with your training program in order to get the most out of your training. The nervous and muscular systems obviously play considerable roles in the outcome of your training, but what’s often ignored is the significance of hormone production. </p> </div> </div>','The results of regular and focused training can be quite remarkable.
